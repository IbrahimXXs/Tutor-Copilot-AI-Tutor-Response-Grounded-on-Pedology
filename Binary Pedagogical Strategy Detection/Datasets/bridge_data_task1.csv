Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart.

Maybe 25. ||| student: Which holiday was that? ||| teacher: I think it was Australia ||| student: Do you still talk to the people you met? ||| teacher: Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them ||| student: Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you? ||| teacher: what do you mean? ||| student: I think it's like a 6th sense, often seen as ""cold readings"" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again. ||| teacher: Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky ||| student: There's this practice called ""Treasure Hunting"" that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There's a book called ""The Ultimate Treasure Hunt"" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love. ||| teacher: So, do you do treasure hunting often? ||| student: I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually, they are vague hope-filled messages, but it's weird when I blurt out something oddly specific. ||| teacher: Hi ||| student: Any plans for the weekend?",my friends are gonna visit me this weekend. we might go hiking!,None,0

I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays. ||| teacher: Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself! ||| student: I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old? ||| teacher: Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome.. ||| student: Are you doing any home decorating then? ||| teacher: Yes!

Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree. ||| teacher: Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year. ||| student: I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh? ||| teacher: Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do. ||| student: I see.

Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions 🙂 So how do i get a fresher outlook? 🙂 ||| student: Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme. ||| teacher: Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea? ||| student: We created a scholarship for leaders from <REDACTED_TERM> to visit an international institute at <REDACTED_TERM> for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort. ||| teacher: Thats great! This is valuable help for the community.

I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it 🙂 ||| student: What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things? ||| teacher: 1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on 🙂 What about you? is there a right answer to this? :) ||| student:  1) The idea of what it must be like to be ""on Earth as it is in Heaven"" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music",Nice!

The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them ||| student: Yea, me too.

That's interesting, borderline spooky ||| student: There's this practice called ""Treasure Hunting"" that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There's a book called ""The Ultimate Treasure Hunt"" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love. ||| teacher: So, do you do treasure hunting often? ||| student: I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger.

Maybe 25. ||| student: Which holiday was that? ||| teacher: I think it was Australia ||| student: Do you still talk to the people you met? ||| teacher: Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them ||| student: Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you? ||| teacher: what do you mean? ||| student: I think it's like a 6th sense, often seen as ""cold readings"" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again. ||| teacher: Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky ||| student: There's this practice called ""Treasure Hunting"" that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There's a book called ""The Ultimate Treasure Hunt"" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love. ||| teacher: So, do you do treasure hunting often? ||| student: I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger.

Maybe 25. ||| student: Which holiday was that? ||| teacher: I think it was Australia ||| student: Do you still talk to the people you met? ||| teacher: Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them ||| student: Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you? ||| teacher: what do you mean? ||| student: I think it's like a 6th sense, often seen as ""cold readings"" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again. ||| teacher: Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky ||| student: There's this practice called ""Treasure Hunting"" that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There's a book called ""The Ultimate Treasure Hunt"" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love. ||| teacher: So, do you do treasure hunting often? ||| student: I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger.
