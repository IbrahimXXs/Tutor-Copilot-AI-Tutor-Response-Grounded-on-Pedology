train,"It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants.",0
train,We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol.,0
train,"I normally don't reflect back too much on things, but i guess 2019 have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance. Why do you ask?",0

train,Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity.,0

train,That's right! Any other characteristics that a square needs to have?,1
train,That's true! A rectangle does have 4 sides. Could you take a look at this shape and let me know whether or not it's a rectangle?,1

train,Oh very cool. I hear its nice over there. Do you go often?,0
train,"You're really close! I can see from your work you are really understanding the concept, you just made a tiny mistake. Can you try to find it?",1
train,Great try! Remember that a ratio should be written as a fraction. In this case we want to write it as men/women,1
train,"I watched a few lately, but nothing is as good as Avatar. what's your favorite?",0
train,yeah was working all night on a homework,0
train,What did you get?,1

train,Great try! Let's check our answer. How can we check our answer?,1
train,I was flying my kite today in the sunshine! What did you have for lunch?,0
train,"It's so that we know use the wrong information when calculating the answer. For example, Abby has 3 apples and 4 bananas. Bob has 2 apples and 6 bananas. How many apples do Abby and Bob have in total?",1
train,"Not quite, but can you find the repeating pattern?",1
train,All good. Planning to head home soon. How about you?,0
train,"Hmm, not quite. This question is asking us to pick the greatest decimal out of the available options. To do this, we just compare the place values from left to right",1
train,Let me help you out a bit. We have 16 apples and 4 kids. We need to figure out how many apples each kid gets if we were to divide the apples evenly,1
train,"Hmm, try taking some <REDACTED_TERM>! I'm going to see the Warriors vs. the Grizzlies. Ever see them play?",0

train,Great try! We could say 7*5=5*7,1
train,"Oddly enough, I also catch Pokémon on my phone. I used to do it more, but it just never ends. I used to do it everyday. Now I mostly catch them when I travel somewhere exotic.",0

train,what happened there? I watched bits of Terminators movies but never a full one,0
train,"That's a great try! When we are multiplying, try to think of x groups of y and how many that would leave you. For example, 3 times 5 would be 3 groups of 5 or 5 groups of 3, which is 15. ",1
train,"I was working on a volunteer project to build a school and I traveled around a bit by myself after. It was more than 10 years ago, so it must have changed a lot.",0

train,"Wow, cool! I think space tourism is going to be big in a decade or so.",0

train,Hope you are having fun doing that 🙂 Any plans for the weekend?,0
train,Great job! Can you explain what a vertex is?,1

train,nice. that's football right?,0
train,Who said I want to be a pastry chef?... haha,0

train,That's a great try! When the minute hand is on the 11 remember to multiply it by 5!,1
train,"Great first try! 4 is the percent. The ""part"" is the portion of the whole we are looking for.",1
train,People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous.,0
train,"Great try! Let's try to think of this as an array. If you have 3 rows of 2 items each, how many total items would you have?",1
train,Are you sure you remembered to add all the sides when you found the perimeter?,1
train,Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha,0
train,"No, not quite. The 5 doesn't mean you count by 5. It means how many times the number to the left of it is multiplied by itself",1
train,Oh you're very close. We have 72 donuts and 6 kids who we're dividing the donuts among. Will each kid get at least 1 donut?,1
train,That isn't quite right - can you define what product means?,1
train,"Hmm, I think this question is asking about the individual sides of the playground.",1
train,yea. what do you plan to buy?,0
train,"Ah, that number is the x1. Remember the y value is how far up/down the coordinate is",1
train,same here! I hope the weather will be nice,0
train,"I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!",0

train,Great! The 5 is in the hundreds spot.,1
train,Oh that's cool! I actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster!,0

train,"Pretty well! I just finished a big project at work, so I’m feeling relieved.",0
train,Kind of I think,0

train,Close! Let's separate it into 50 + 10 and 4 + 1. Could you tell me what 50 + 10 is?,1
train,Let's recheck that answer using our calculator. I would like for you to put this problem in your calculator. What is your answer?,1
train,"Great try! When we convert fractions to decimals we want to think about it as part of a whole. So, 1/2 is 0.5 because 0.5 is half of 1!",1
train,Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.,0
train,Great! Please give the next problem a try,1
train,ziplining?,0
train,I think it was Australia,0

train,"Ah, not quite. Could you let me know why you think this shape is a pentagon?",1
train,john mayer:)\,0
train,"Oh you're close. Is this a 2D shape, or 3D shape?",1
train,Great try! Let's not forget the hundreds place. When we round 894 to the tens we get..,1
train,"I’ve been doing well, just super busy with work.",0

train,"yes , for the most part . It doesnt feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway .",0

train,"How do you do , Prof.Smith .",0
train,January 5th .,0

train,Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ?,0
train,What ? Beg your pardon .,0

train,not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .,0
train,"About 40 percent , if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast , I can only catch a word here and there . But Mr . Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help , my Chinese is getting better and better e",0

train,"He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I wont .",0
train,"Well , I didnt clean the house and I didnt study . I stayed in bed and watched TV .",0

train,Thats no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . Thats easy.And probably its the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . Thats a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .,0

train,What do you mean ?,0
train,It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier .,0
train,"Yes , I think you re right . I m thinking about having a child , but not just yet .",0
train,And ?,0
train,You can ask me any question at any time .,0
train,Aha . Ive read of my roommate . I made a move today .,0

train,Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .,0
train,Thats the style ! You just wear boxers .,0
train,The mosquitos are biting me !,0
train,There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .,0
train,There is no need to be so frustrated .,0
train,"Yes , it s exciting . This month we are doing crossword puzzles .",0
train,"It has stopped snowing , but its even colder .",0
train,Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think .,0
train,"Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church .",0
train,"Well , their team work is well worth learning .",0
train,She s a librarian at the public library .,0
train,Oh no .,0
train,Which room are you in ?,0
train,I like playing chess .,0
train,Yeah . Li Nas mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbours daughter got married with a Canadian . Shes almost driving Li Na crazy .,0
train,"Yes , thats why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .",0
train,"Well , lets go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . Its a little expensive , but its fun .",0
train,Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us .,0
train,Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ?,0
train,I Ve already got it . Thanks .,0
train,"Don t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him .",0
train,Would you please write your name on this list ?,0
train,"Yes , its really wonderful !",0
train,Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?,0
train,How may I help you ?,0
train,Sure . I think it s a fantastic place to go .,0
train,Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ?,0
train,Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .,0
train,Yep . Its the kickoff of the barbecue season . Were invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow .,0
train,"Thats right . You dont drink coffee , do you ?",0
train,Is she going to be okay ?,0
train,Is sailing fun ?,0
train,Im afraid it gains a little .,0
train,I see.so this is your hometown ?,0
train,"Hi , Mary . You look pale today . Whats the matter with you ?",0
train,"You have your library card , right ?",0
train,"Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , whens your birthday ?",0
train,"I want to improve my handwriting , and Ive practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad .",0
train,"In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger .",0
train,"Sure , a promise is a promise .",0
train,"That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all .",0
train,how did you get that burn again ?,0
train,Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ?,0
train,"Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?",0
train,"All right , see you later .",0
train,"No , it cant be . Really ? Who ?",0
train,"I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding .",0
train,"Then , you are to walk to work .",0
train,"All right , Bill.Here s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast .",0
train,You often like comparing children with their parents .,0
train,"They re fine , but I can t watch a movie without popcorn .",0

train,"Oh yes , I loved it . Wasnt the scene with the judge great ?",0
train,Did you see May today ?,0
train,Not very much . Classical music sends me to sleep,0
train,What did you do ?,0
train,"Merry Christmas , Lee !",0
train,"I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They re famous , so everyone loves them .",0

train,What are your hours ?,0
train,"Yes , my wife is coming to get me .",0
train,So whats the problem ?,0
train,"Oh , I see .",0
train,I think so . Maybe hes fallen for her .,0
train,Have a nice journey ! Do give my regards to your parents .,0
train,"Yeah , my head hurts , that s all . I Ve been in physics class all day . It s killer !",0
train,I am trying to find this book .,0
train,It is such a nice place .,0
train,I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition .,0
train,I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ?,0

train,"Well , it pays off for her.How old is she anyway ?",0
train,"Anyway , it s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where s the scientific rigor in that ?",0
train,I wish the store close to us was open 24 house a day .,0
train,we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice .,0
train,"Look , there are some words on the fish .",0
train,"I had mine when I was 24 . that s a little young . I d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .",0
train,Im not . I just dont feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think Im fat ?,0
train,"Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too .",0
train,"Okay , thats good .",0
train,"I believe such things won t be realized , just daydreaming .",0
train,Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I m in level two and I m loving my class this semester ! It s great being in a class of international students !,0
train,"I don t agree with you . I maintain that we re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago .",0
train,"If he promised to help you , Im sure he will help . Hes a man of his word .",0
train,Yep . And I should start planning now .,0
train,When will the lecture begin ?,0
train,Whats wrong with him ?,0
train,Shes my grandma .,0
train,Good try! Let's try to count the number of sides and points in each of the shape,1
train,Can you show on the whiteboard your first step to get that answer?,1
train,"You're very close. This question is asking what number is in the hundreds place. In other words, we're looking for a single digit",1
train,Right on! The remainder is 1.,1
train,Exactly! 5 is the right answer.,1
train,"Try isolating x by dividing both sides by 3. This way, you’ll have x by itself.",1
train,Great! You can use either side as the length or width,1
train,Try thinking of it as ‘how many groups of 8 are in 40.’,1
train,"Oh, what makes you say that?",1
train,Can you number the sides of the shape on the whiteboard?,1
train,"Good work, 3 is the right answer!",1
train,Try finding the largest number that divides both 9 and 12 evenly. That’s the greatest common factor.,1
train,"Hmm, not quite. Take a look at the picture again. How many parts is it broken into?",1
train,"You're on the right track! You are correct that the 5 in the hundreds should be rounded to a 6, but when we round then the answer should be 2600.",1
train,"Imagine you have 5 apples, and you add 3 more. In total, you’d have 8 apples.",1
train,"That was a good try, but that answer is not correct. When we look at the number 329, the 2 is in the tens place and the 9 is in the ones place. Do you understand? ",1
train,Practicing with similar addition problems like this will help solidify your skills.,1
train,"Divide the numerator and denominator by the greatest common factor, which is 5 in this case.",1
train,"We find the total number of bags by multiplying. If there are 2 bags and each bag has 10 legos, how many legos are in the 2 bags?",1
train,"Close, but let's add to that definition! A shape is figure that has lines and angles. Can you give me an example of a shape? What's your favorite shape?",1
train,"Adding 0.5 and 0.5 gives 1.0, not 0.10.",1
train,Nice job! 16 is the correct result.,1
train,"Yes, 36 is absolutely correct!",1
train,Perfect! 32 is the correct answer.,1
train,"Subtract 3 from both sides to get 2x = 8, then divide by 2 to find x = 4, not 6.",1
train,Ok! Let's try another one. How many wholes do 6 halves make?,1
train,"Divide 28 by 5, then check what’s left after the closest multiple of 5.",1
train,Great try! Can you please explain how you got 68?,1
train,Division is about splitting into equal parts. This is why the result is smaller.,1
train,Most of your work looks great! Can you recheck your final answer?,1
train,"Hmm, not quite. We are looking for how many apples Anna and Bob have combined. Don't count any of the other fruits that they have. Only apples",1
train,"Hm, not quite. Every time you multiply a number by 10, all you have to do is add a 0 to the end",1
train,Good thinking! 17 is correct.,1
train,"Divide 100 by 5 to find one-fifth, then multiply by 4 to get four-fifths.",1
train,"100 cm is equal to 1 meter, as there are 100 centimeters in a meter.",1
train,"Hm, not quite. Could you tell me how you got 167?",1
train,"1/3 of 9 is 3, because dividing 9 into three equal parts gives you 3.",1
train,"Yes, there are 8 squares. To get the area, we need to multiply the 2 and 4, not add them",1
train,This similar problem reinforces your understanding of calculating percentages.,1
train,Exactly. They also have three angles that add up to 180 degrees.,1
train,"Yes, 60 is right. Nice job!",1
train,"1/4 of 40 is 10, not 15.",1
train,"Hmm, not quite. This question is asking us to round 18 to the nearest tens. Do you know how to tell whether we need to round up or round down?",1
train,That’s exactly right! The area is 20.,1
train,Perfect! 20 is the answer.,1
train,"You are on the right track. You gave a number in the middle of 3 and 5, not the biggest. Can you try again?",1
train,"20% of 150 is actually 30, not 25.",1
train,Starting at -5 and adding 3 brings you to -2 on the number line.,1
train,"This is a common mistake. To find the percent change, you take how much it changed, divide it by the original amount, and finally multiply by 100",1
train,"You're right in that picture 3 has a line of symmetry, but the question is asking for the image with all lines of symmetry drawn through the square. ",1
train,Decimal numbers have a period separating the whole part from the fraction. Is this a decimal number?,1
train,Practicing this similar division problem will reinforce your understanding of dividing by 10.,1
train,This similar problem is great for practicing addition with slightly larger numbers.,1
train,"Think of a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 64.",1
train,"15/45 simplifies to 1/3, not 1/2.",1
train,This similar fraction problem reinforces the concept of thirds.,1
train,This similar percentage problem will help deepen your understanding of how percentages work.,1
train,Absolutely right! 55 is the answer.,1
train,"73 rounds to 70, as it’s closer to 70 than to 80.",1
train,"One strategy is to divide 250 by 10, which will give you 10%.",1
train,"Try breaking it down by adding 10 to 25 first, then add the remaining 5.",1
train,Half of 30 is 15. Give it another go!,1
train,"You're close, however the formula to find the speed of the train is miles per hour.",1
train,"3 squared means 3 × 3, which equals 9.",1
train,"Hm, not quite. Could you let me know how you got 30?",1
train,Great job! Let's try another problem. Can you find the product of 200 and 100?,1
train,Adding 9 and 6 gives you 15.,1
train,"Try dividing 40 by 8 to find one-eighth, then multiply by 3.",1
train,Your work looks great but there's a small mistake,1
train,"The prefix for six sides is hexa, so what would a six sided shape be called?",1
train,"You seem unsure, and that's ok! Let's look at another example. If the sides of the rectangle are 3 and 5, we multiply those together to get the area, which would be 15.",1
train,"Actually, 8 divided by 4 equals 2, not 1.",1
train,Perfect answer! 9 is right.,1
train,"Find 50% of 120, then find 25%, and add those two results to get 75%.",1
train,50 divided by 10 actually gives 5. Try that again.,1
train,"Remember that 25% is one-fourth, so divide 90 by 4.",1
train,This similar fraction problem helps reinforce your understanding of thirds.,1
train,This similar addition problem helps reinforce your skills with adding larger numbers.,1
train,Good try but let's look at the problem again. How many spaces is the point from the origin? Let's put our finger on the grid and count.,1
train,What was the first step you took to get the answer? Can you show me on the whiteboard?,1
train,"Sorry, I said that wrong.",1
train,Great! Please give this a try. Which of the following fractions are equivalent to 3/6?,1
train,Close! A hexagon actually has 6 sides. A pentagon has 5 sides.,1
train,Ok great - in the corner you can see your points add up.,1
train,"Think of a pizza cut into parts. If you take half and add a quarter, you’ll have 3/4 of the pizza.",1
train,"Hmm, not quite. Could you let me know how you got 9?",1
train,This similar problem helps you practice adding slightly larger numbers.,1
train,"Break it into easier parts: multiply 10 by 3, then 4 by 3, and add the results.",1
train,This is a similar addition problem to give you more practice.,1
train,This similar example will reinforce your understanding of finding perimeter.,1
train,"4 cubed is 4 × 4 × 4, which equals 64, not 24.",1
train,"The square of 8 is 64, not 15.",1
train,Yes that is correct! Tony surveys all the students.,1
train,"You're close. We need 24 for our answer, but 24 is not the final answer",1
train,Great! Could you give this question a try?,1
train,"Hm, I'm not sure I understand. We want to determine whether the two lines shown are parallel, perpendicular, or neither",1
train,"Great try! Keep in mind that there are two values on the protractor, one for obtuse and one acute. Is this an obtuse or acute angle?",1
train,Great try! Remember that with multiplication you cannot just multiply the tens digit and the ones digit.,1
train,"Yes, that’s correct. Nicely done!",1
train,This similar problem helps you practice finding area with different dimensions.,1
train,Great try! When we are finding length we should subtract the smaller endpoint's value from the larger.,1
train,"Well done, 8 is the right answer.",1
train,"Hmm, not quite. This question is asking us to compare 25.9 and 25.10 and determine which one is bigger.",1
train,That's right!,1
train,"Hey, I think you have the right idea, but made a small mistake",1
train,"Remember 0 cm represents no distance so if you have a length of 4 cm and take away 0 from it, what's left?",1
train,"Let's look at a similar problem. If you have 2 boxes and each box has 3 toys in it, how many total toys do you have?",1
train,That is incorrect. Please use your calculator to double check your answer.  ,1
train,"Good job determining the place value. Now, let's line up the numbers vertically.",1
train,This similar problem will help reinforce your understanding of fractions.,1
train,That would be correct if we were trying to find 5 + 4,1
train,This is another multiplication problem that will reinforce what you learned.,1
train,"Close! The value is 2000, but what is the place value?",1
train,"Here, let's count it in 1 hour intervals. Let's start at 7:30pm and increase the hour by 1 until we get to or pass 11:00pm. Could you try that?",1
train,"The square root of 81 is actually 9, not 8.",1
train,"Ah, not quite. 5 x 10 is 50. 5 x 6 is something else. Could you give it another try?",1
train,"Round each number to the nearest ten, add them, then adjust slightly.",1
train,20 minus 8 equals 12. Imagine starting with 20 apples and taking away 8.,1
train,Nice job! 15 is the correct answer.,1
train,"Ah, you're very close!",1
train,How did you get 30 for the area?,1
train,That is so close! Can you double-check your work?,1
train,"Let's work this together. If there are 16 ounces in one pound, how many ounces are in two pounds? We add 16 + 16 to find the answer. What is your answer?",1
train,"2, 0, and 4 are all in the ""thousands"" section. Do you want to try again?",1
train,"Great! You are correct that we should round to the tenths place, but we would not round to 0.4.",1
train,Not quite. Let's find the length together. You have to add the length of the two segments. Which numbers would you add together? ,1
train,Great try! We want to estimate the total number of balloons in the two groups. How many balloons do you estimate in 1?,1
train,"Think of 13 as 10 + 3, multiply each part by 9, then add the results.",1
train,Great try. When we want to change a whole number into a fraction we do not want to change it's value.,1
